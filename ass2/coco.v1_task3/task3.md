### Task 3

Yes, the functional language developed in week 6 can be described as coco-file.  

##### Classes that couldn't be generated 

All classes would be generated by coco expect these: 

- `enum Type`
- `Environment`
- `FunEnvironment`
- `faux`

##### Additional classes

The coco would generate additional classes for all data types that has only one alternative. Among these are:

- `FunAbstract`
- `ValueAbstract` 
- `TypeIDAbstract`
- `StartAbstract`

However, it is possible to implement `coco`  so that it doesn't generate these classes by adding extra logic that checks how many alternatives the data type has. If it has only one so  the data type extends directly `AST` and the implementation is inside that class. Thus, there is no need to declare that `FunActract extends AST` and `Fun extends FunAbstract` . 

##### Additional changes

- In `main.java` caste `ast` variable to `Start` type, because there is no `eval()` declaration in abstract `AST` class.
